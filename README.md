# SCI_2025
Statistics &amp; Causal Inference PhD Course 2025

This course introduces students to the use of probabilistic models to answer scientific questions. We will cover three core subjects: (i) probability theory, (ii) Bayesian statistics, and (iii) causal inference. We will also engage with some information theory. The goal is to develop a strong understanding of these fundamentals (which apply broadly across research areas) using Monte Carlo methods for simulation and estimation.

This course involves many hands-on exercises in R, because the only way to learn how to analyze data is to analyze *a lot* of data. Students should have the latest versions of R and Richard McElreath's [`rethinking` package installed])(https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/). An IDE such as RStudio or VSCode is also highly reccomended. The course will be in English.

## Accessing course content and attending class

We will meet on Fridays via Zoom at TBA, with the meeting link shared to registered participants. The course will feature "flipped" instruction: participants should come already having watched lectures and attempted the exercises for the week, and our class time will be used to solve problems together. Lectures and readings will be posted at least one week in advance.

The primary text for this course is the [2nd edition of Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/). It is available as both a physical book and an eBook. A full series of lectures by the author is [available for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN).
